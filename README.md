# Dangerous-em-Font-Size
Craziness the unit em can have on font-size(ing).
In the html, we have nested lists, which demonstrates the the cascading effect ems can have on font size. The nested list is not a likely scenario, so there is a more realistic example in our call-to-action section. In this section, we see how parent ems have a multiplicative effect upon child elements, which ends up with some unintended results. Solution: use rem for setting font size. Take a look.
